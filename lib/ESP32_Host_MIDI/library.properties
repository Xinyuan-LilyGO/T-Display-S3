sentence=MIDI hub for ESP32 — USB Host, BLE, Apple MIDI/WiFi, OSC, Ethernet, UART/DIN-5, ESP-NOW, USB Device, MIDI 2.0.
paragraph=Connect USB MIDI keyboards via USB Host OTG; receive BLE MIDI from iPhone, iPad, and iOS apps; bridge DAWs with Apple MIDI / RTP-MIDI over WiFi or Ethernet (W5500/P4); control Max/MSP and Pure Data via OSC; reach vintage DIN-5 synthesizers over serial UART; link ESP32 boards wirelessly with ESP-NOW; exchange Universal MIDI Packets at MIDI 2.0 resolution (16-bit velocity, 32-bit CC/pitch-bend). All 9 transports share a single event queue and unified API — any incoming MIDI is auto-forwarded to all others. Chord detection, active note tracking, PSRAM history, thread-safe queue. Supports ESP32-S3, S2, P4, and classic ESP32. Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, ESP-IDF.
